# README.MD

notes inspired by the TIL style developed by [Josh Branchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til). What I don't like about Branchaud's style is that it atomizies information 
away from its greater context which can limit the understanding for future learning.

Beyond that I realize I need a way to centralize my notes to use for future teams or
to prove that I do have the knowledge I say that I do on my resume and LinkedIN. So I guess
I will have to 'backfill' my knowledge of certain areas including Tableau, SQL, C/C++,Pyton,Pandas, GNU/Linux, nvim, AWS, and

It's really about doing a little at a time or just when you can to make progress toward a goal. My goal
right now is to learn to love my contributions chain. It's not even about writing code everyday but simply
progress and proof that I know what I'm talking about. Not only that but I know I eventually want to start
a blog and writing on a computer is a lot harder for me because of academic trauma. In fact coding itself 
became so scary to me during the pandemic (for reasons I'll delve into later mayber through the blog).
